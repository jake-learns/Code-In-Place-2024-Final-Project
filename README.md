# Generic Space Shooter

## This game is an early model side-scrolling bullet hell. It was made as a final project for Stanford's 2024 Code In Place program. 

### It's made entirely in Python leveraging [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/).
### Sound effects in part sourced from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/).
### Music for the game was sourced from the [Wreckage Free Album](https://onemansymphony.bandcamp.com/album/wreckage-free).
### Assets for some sprites were sourced from [CraftPix](https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-spaceship-pixel-art-sprite-sheets/?num=1&count=53&sq=ship&pos=4)


In addition to the sources above, I used [Aesprite](https://aseprite.org/) to modify some of the free assets. I spent a lot of time ensuring that the animations looked good on the player and enemy sprites. I needed lots of modifications to fit my needs. 

Additional thanks goes out to [Bob](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/public/user/zxtfGx5IJFaKA4BmajxSDzzIP7d2) for allowing the use of his image and voice for a special boss, which is enabled in the Options.
